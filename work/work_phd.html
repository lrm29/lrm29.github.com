<p>
My PhD work concerns the modelling of turbulent, multiphase, reactive flows. More specifically using population balances to obtain more detailed simulations of processes such as liquid-liquid contacting.

<p>
I will make some code available from time to time at "Github":http://github.com/lrm29. Below are some documents/presentations that are associated with my PhD work.
