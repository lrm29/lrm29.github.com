Here's a patch for OpenFOAM to add RADAU as an ODE solver. Simply apply the patch to create a folder within /src/ODE/ODESolver called RADAU, then remake the folder ODE using `wmake libso'.

You can test RADAU using /applications/test/ODETest. Here's how it roughly performs to SIBS:

RADAU:

Analytical: y(2.0) = 4(0.223891 0.576725 0.352834 0.128943)
Numerical:  y(2.0) = 4(0.223891 0.576725 0.352834 0.128943)

SIBS:

Analytical: y(2.0) = 4(0.223891 0.576725 0.352834 0.128943)
Numerical:  y(2.0) = 4(0.223891 0.576725 0.352833 0.128944)

There's still some work to do to integrate it properly. If there's interest let me know or have a go yourself!
