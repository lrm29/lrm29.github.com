title: Eclipse Helios and Fedora 14

I found that the C++ indexer in Eclipse Helios crashed the application in Fedora 14. Obviously this was
slightly annoying if I want to use it as an IDE...

Anyway, apparently it's due to Java, and there's a simple hack here to get it working:

"Eclipse CDT indexer crashes in Fedora 14":https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=647737

In essence, just add the following to /etc/eclipse.ini:

{% highlight bash %}
-XX:-UseCompressedOops
{% endhighlight %}

This is just a quick fix: They're continuing to find a proper solution.
