title: OpenFOAM/F13 Linking Issue Fixed
categories: [openfoam, fedora]
---

The issue in post "OpenFOAM Fedora 13 Fork":/openfoam/fedora/2010/08/30/openfoam-fork.html has been fixed in the OpenFOAM-1.7.x repository. Fedora's Gcc has implicit linking turned off.

To turn it back on again add the following option to g++:

{% highlight bash %}
-Xlinker --add-needed
{% endhighlight %}
