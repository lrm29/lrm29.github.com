title: OpenFOAM-2.0 Released
categories: [openfoam]

"OpenFOAM-2.0":http://www.openfoam.com has been released, and there are lots of exciting "new features":http://www.openfoam.com/version2.0.0!

I'm happy to say that the "Git repository":http://www.openfoam.com/download/git.php installs on Fedora 15 smoothly.

The namespace storing math constants had changed, so to update all the namespace declarations in my own code I ran the following:

{% highlight bash %}
grep -lre 'mathematicalConstant::' . | xargs -d'\n' sed -i 's/mathematicalConstant::/constant::mathematical::/g'
{% endhighlight %}

Hope that helps some of you.
