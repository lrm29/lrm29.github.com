In 2007 I graduated with a BA and MEng in Chemical Engineering from Robinson College, University of Cambridge and joined the CoMo Group.

<br>
I am interested in modelling particle formation and transport in reactive flows by the coupling and development of stochastic 
particle algorithms to both commercial (STAR-CD) and open source (<a href="http://www.openfoam.org">OpenFOAM</a>) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes that are 
capable of handling complex geometries.
